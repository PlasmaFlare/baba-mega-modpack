-- OVERRIDE: keep karma after undoing

--[[ @Merge: delete() was merged ]]


-- OVERRIDE: update code if new unit is "ECHO"

--[[ @Merge: create() was merged ]]


-- OVERRIDE: check for code updates if ECHO is present

--[[ @Merge: update() was merged ]]


-- OVERRIDE: keep track of any text at the level position (including the level itself if it was converted) - This probably doesn't work with levels within levels
-- Also keep track of whether the level was sinful when entering
-- ALSO keep track of what object the level is (AMBIENT)

--[[ @Merge: getlevelsurrounds() was merged ]]


-- OVERRIDE: show what object the AMBIENT text is currently targeting (this doesn't really work anymore with the hacky implementation)

--[[ @Merge: writerules() was merged ]]


-- OVERRIDE: also keep track of ECHO units

--[[ @Merge: delunit() was merged ]]
