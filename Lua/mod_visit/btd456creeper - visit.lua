--Visit Mod - by Btd456Creeper

--Full levelsurrounds format:
--Divided into multiple level entries. Also, every term is followed by a comma.
--Each entry starts with "levelseparator", then the ID of the level tile on the map,
--then that tile's target level file, level number and visual type (number, letter, or dots), and direction.
--Then for each direction (including diagonals and no direction): The direction name (in one or two letters),
--followed by every object in that direction (or a hyphen if there's nothing there).
--Special case: if an object has level data, put its tile ID right before its object name.

--As of v1.2.1, at the start of the levelsurrounds is the parent level.
--This is used to prevent a bug caused by the fact that entering the level you're currently in doesn't update the leveltree.

--Example: 1level,levelseparator,2.59410404,2level,1,0,0,r,baba,u,skull,house,l,-,d,2.74583175,level,dr,-,ur,-,ul,-,dl,-,o,-,levelseparator,2.74583175,3level,2,1,0,r,-,u,2.59410404,level,l,-,d,-,dr,-,ur,baba,ul,-,dl,-,o,-,
