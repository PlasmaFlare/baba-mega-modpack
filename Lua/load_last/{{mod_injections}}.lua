        - (see giant block comment below)
        - treat "not stable" condtype as "stable".
            - invertconds() can change condtype "stable" to "not stable". "stable" as a condtype technically doesn't make sense. It's more of a hacky way to prevent other non-stable rules from affecting stable objects.
              So if we somehow end up with a "not stable" condition, treat it as a normal "stable" condtype.

		@mods(stable) - if a stableunit is being checked, the set of conditions must have the "stable" cond in order
		to make sure that the stableunit only has stablerules applied.

		EXCEPTIONS:
		- When GLOBAL_checking_stable == true. This is a global that tells is set to true whenever we intend to do a testcond() on a "X is stable" rule.
			Rules in the form of "X is stable" should never be a stablerule (aka, appear in the list of rules when hovering a stableunit with mouse).
			So it makes sense that we should not perform this check when testing "X is stable".
		- When conds == nil. NOT WHEN conds == {}. In the rare cases where testcond() gets passed in nil instead of an empty table
			for conds, the code just wants all units regardless of conditions. (At least, thats what I gathered from
			handling the special case of "teeth eat baba"; It calls findtype() while passing in nil conds). I'm guessing that
			other cases where the game passes an empty table means that the game wants to consider conditions.
			WARNING: this is a pretty unfounded assumption that can collapse easily.

        @NOTE: There was a bug that was originally handled in commit #582f9fd8cef2585c37cabc85880de90a7d66a6cf. However, with the new condition system, I basically removed that fix.
        But for *some* reason, the issue doesn't *seem* to happen even without the fix. And I don't know why lol. For now, I'll trust that the issue won't happen.
        But this will bug me to no end.

        To explain what I found so far, if you have "text on baba is stable", "text is push", "text is not push", and trigger the stable, the issue would make non-stable texts be pushable.
        But in the new system, the non-stablerule "text is push" gets modified by both stablerule and non-stablerule versions of "text is not push". This will end up with a final rule of:
            text is push | (not stable)[(text is not push)] && never[] && stable[(text is push | (not stable)[(text is not push)] && never[])]

        So the "never" effectively cancels out the non-stablerule "text is push". *sigh* Buuttt, there's a whole alot of implications that I don't want to dive into right now.

        Revisit this later on.
